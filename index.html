                <p>This is my little Choose Your Own Adventure.
                    For now it will just be a static world you can travel around,
                    like perhaps a maze.</p>
                <p>Hello, world!</p>
                <p>I'm thinking about what to do next.
                    <s>I should probably add CSS next.</s>
                    Got some nice CSS now!</p>
                <p>First I think I'll make a village. (Partway done!)<br/>
                    Want to <a href="village.html">go to the village?</a><p>
                <p>Ok, I think I've learned everything I can from the village concept, and it's getting pretty boring. So next step time.
            <ol>I can:
            <li><p>I can add JavaScript and try to learn more about cookies.</p>
                The easiest way to do this is to make the "game" dynamic, with a personal inventory, etc.</li>
            <li>I can try to learn more formatting, tags, navigation interfaces, etc. JS-free design basics.</br>
                For this I can create articles about something I know reasonably well, in a cross-linked wiki format.
                Maybe offer some personal thoughts on cognition as related to theories in the wild.</li></ol></p>
                <p>Since it's harder for me to fuck anything up by just adding another section to the site,
                    I've decided to go with option #2 first.</p>
